## Features
- Aimmy but it's Arduino
- Undetected on some games where Aimmy is detected (Apex Legends works, a lot of games have since flagged Aimmy though.)

## Setup Tutorial
0. Video: [Setup Tutorial on Streamable](https://streamable.com/c77jhu) https://streamable.com/c77jhu (Text tutorial below)
1. Download Arduino IDE 1.8.19 ("legacy" download on arduino.cc)
2. Drag the libraries folder into Documents\Arduino\libraries (replace the old libraries folder with the one here, be careful not to corrupt your old libraries)
3. Run the spoofer, spoof according to the correct mouse.
4. Upload the script in the serial folder. (NO USB HOST SHIELD SUPPORT, PLUG MOUSE INTO PC OR ADD USB HOST SHIELD SUPPORT TO SCRIPT MANUALLY)
5. Open Device Manager, go to Ports (COM & LPT), then look for the Arduino COM Port ("USB Serial Device"). Remember what number it is.
6. Open Aimmy Arduino Edition (Spotify.exe or SpotifyTh3m1daProtected.exe, protected is better), then in settings slide the COM port to the right one. Then, click save.
7. Use like normal Aimmy.

**WARNING: THIS CHEAT IS DETECTED ON FORTNITE AND YOU WILL GET DELAY BANNED!!**

## Troubleshooting
- Will update in the future. Haven't had any testers yet.

- The Aimmy Developers, because this is just Aimmy with some mods.
- Whoswhip, for their fork of Aimmy which includes bezier curve, DirectX screen capture, and other such features.

## How to Use Bezier Curve
In the Aim Config Settings you will find the bezier curve strength option, increasing this will give the aim path a stronger curve, whilst decreasing it will give the aim path a straighter line.

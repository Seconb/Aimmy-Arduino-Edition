# Aimmy
This is a fork of Aimmy made by me with a lot of new features and a lot of removed features.
## Features
```diff
+ General Optimization
+ DirectX Screen Capturing (Taylor's Aimmy Cuda)
+ Third Person Support (Fov Settings)
+ Bezier Curve Strength
+ Debug Mode (AI Loop Speed)

- Prediction Removed
- Data Collection Removed
- GDI Screen Capturing Removed
```
## How to Use Bezier Curve
In the Aim Config Settings you will find the bezier curve strength option, increasing this will give the aim path a stronger curve, whilst decreasing it will give the aim path a straighter line.

## Features
- **Easy Setup:** Setup in just a few clicks.
- **Undetected Gameplay:** Undetected in every game except Fortnite, Valorant, and CS2. Arduino Leonardo required.
- **USB Host Shield Support:** Added support for USB Host Shields, though this support probably won't work on Logitech and Razer mice. Many mice will have scroll wheel and side button issues.
- **Improvements over normal Aimmy: **This uses Whoswhip's fork of Aimmy, which features the following:
```diff
+ General Optimization
+ DirectX Screen Capturing (Taylor's Aimmy Cuda)
+ Third Person Support (Fov Settings)
+ Bezier Curve Strength
+ Debug Mode (AI Loop Speed)

- Prediction Removed
- Data Collection Removed
- GDI Screen Capturing Removed
```

## Setup Tutorial
0. Before Arduino Setup, make sure you have WMIC (Windows 11 Users only): https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/how-to-install-wmic-feature-on-demand-on-windows-11/4189530
[![Video Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1aRrjKzYCG0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aRrjKzYCG0)
1. Go to the Arduino Setup folder, and run the **Arduino Setup.bat**.
2. Type **y** if you're using your USB Host Shield (you don't have to use it, detection in games won't change). If not, type **n**.
3. Press the reset button on your Arduino, wait until you hear your Arduino disconnect and reconnect, then press enter.
4. Do all the other setup that would be required for normal Aimmy (installing redistributables)
5. Run Aimmy, and change your mouse movement method to Arduino.

## Troubleshooting
- Will update in the future. Haven't had any testers yet.

- The Aimmy Developers, because this is just Aimmy with some mods.
- Whoswhip, for their fork of Aimmy which includes bezier curve, DirectX screen capture, and other such features.

## How to Use Bezier Curve
In the Aim Config Settings you will find the bezier curve strength option, increasing this will give the aim path a stronger curve, whilst decreasing it will give the aim path a straighter line.
